# 10-SVG-EF
Evan Fodemski module 10 project for DU bootcamp

# Description
In this project, I created an SVG generator with customizable features, including the shape (Circle, Square, or Triangle), custom text (up to 3 letters), text color (keyword or hexadecimal), and shape color (keyword or hexadecimal). This project was a great learning experience, and although I encountered some difficulties, I managed to complete it successfully. I feel a lot more confident now about running tests, and while working on this project, something in my mind seemed to have really fallen into place. I had been getting good grades and completing projects on all but one prior to this, but in this Module 10 project, I was truly confident in writing my own code for the first time and wasn't constantly searching on Google. This was really awesome. Thank you for this opportunity, and I am excited for upcoming classes and assignments.

# Sample SVG
